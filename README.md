## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Roster Generation:** Select from a list of available players and instantly generate a roster.
- **Pivoted Table View:** View the roster with players as rows and roles as columns for a clear overview of each player's capabilities.
- **Tier-Based Grouping:** Champions are automatically grouped by tier (S, A, B, etc.) within each cell.
- **Shared Pick Highlighting:** Automatically highlights any champion that can be played by more than one of the selected players.
- **Interactive Drafting Mode:** Click a cell to "lock in" a player for a specific role. This grays out all other conflicting options, making it easy to build a final team composition.

### Installation

To install all dependencies for both the backend and frontend, run:

```bash
task install
```

### Running the Application

To run the development servers, you'll need two separate terminals:

**Terminal 1: Run the Backend**

```bash
task dev:backend
```

**Terminal 2: Run the Frontend**

```bash
task dev:frontend
```

Once both servers are running, you can access the web UI at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite is using).
